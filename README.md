# Bending-InfiniteCollisions
This adds a new feature created from scratch to the Project Korra API which allows for a groundbreaking new mechanic of Customizable Collisions Between Abilities

Using the configuration file, you can select any two bending abilities and create custom interactions when they collide. This was created from the ground up and brings an entirely new level to the world of Bending servers.
